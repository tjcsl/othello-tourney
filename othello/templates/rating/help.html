        Othello Rating
    </h3>
    <p>
        The rating is a metric used to measure an AI's performance. This server uses the Elo system.
    </p>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline">
        How do I enter the rating?
    </h5>
    <p>
        Because computing power is limited, only AIs past a certain threshold of skill will be included in the rating.
        <br><br>
        Specifically, this means that for your AI to be entered in the rating, it must first qualify through passing the gauntlet. The gauntlet is a series of 3 benchmark AIs. To pass the gauntlet, one game will be played against each, and your AI will have to win 3/3. 
    </p>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline">
        How is rating calculated?
    </h5>
    <p>
        A modified Elo system is used to prioritize wins while also rewarding higher token differences. The exact rating change code is shown below:
        <pre><code>
            def calculateElo(r1, r2, score):
                # Let K = 32
                # And r1 >= r2
                assert r1 >= r2
                p = (1 / (1 + 10 ** ((r1-r2) / 400)))
                expected = 64 * (1-p) - 32

                score = score*p + (32 if score > 0 else -32 if score < 0 else 0)
                
                delta = (32 / 64) * (score - expected)
                return round(delta) 
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline">
        How do ranked matches work?
    </h5>
    <p>
        Ranked matches will be run a few times a week. Tenatively, this is Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 4pm. You can view the next scheduled batch of rank games on the standings page.
        <br><br>
        For each ranked batch, qualified AIs will be matched against each other. Similarly rated AIs will be matched together. Each AI will play 2 games.
    </p>
