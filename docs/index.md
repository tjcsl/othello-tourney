## What is Othello?
If you are new to Othello (AKA Reversi), please check out the
[official rules](https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english)[^1].

[^1]: We play a variant of Othello that cares not only about having more
tokens then the opponent, but also about _how many_ more tokens the winner
has compared to the opponent.

## What is Othello Tourney?
Othello Tourney is a TJ CSL service that allows students to compete to build
the best Othello AI. In a match, one player will play as "x", and the other as "o",
corresponding to black and white respectively.
On their turn, a player's python code has a limited amount of time to find the
optimal move for the current board. Whoever wins the most tokens at the end of the
game is considered the winner.

The amount of time given varies based on the match, and other factors. Good Citizen timing
(AKA Time Hoarding) means that if a player takes up less time than the maximum allotted on that
term, the excess time is added on to their time limit on the next turn. In this scheme,
it is thus useful to spend less time on the earlier moves so that more time can be spent
on the later moves.

Othello Tourney also hosts the annual TJ Othello Competition, where the best scoring bots
of all TJ students and alumni compete to find the best bot.
